- Clone the repository
- Then place the tests at the root of their respective exercises and follow the command below to run the script.

## RPN Test - test_ex01.sh
In this test, we will be evaluating the behavior of an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator program. The program will take in a sequence of mathematical expressions in RPN format and output their result. We will also be testing the program's error handling capabilities by passing in invalid input scenarios

## Running the Test
``` bash test_ex01.sh```

## PmergeMe Test - test_ex02.sh
This repository contains a simple test of the PmergeMe program, which sorts a list of integers using parallel merge sort.
These sets of parameters will include letters, negative numbers, ordered sequences, and random sequences. This will help us determine if the program can handle various input scenarios and if it produces the expected output.

## Running the Test
``` bash test_ex02.sh```
